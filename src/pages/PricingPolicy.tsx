          </h2>
          <p>
            We offer personalized pricing based on the scope, complexity, and
            outcomes of the services requested. Each service quote is shared
            with you in advance, reflecting the time, effort, and quality
            involved. Typically, our pricing ranges from INR 500 to INR 14,000
            depending on the nature of the service.

          </h2>
          <p>
            We are committed to offering competitive pricing. If you find a
            similar product or service (matching in specifications, color, and
            size) at a lower price from a comparable retailer, we will do our
            best to match that price.

          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> We do not match prices from auction sites,
            outlet stores, or websites offering discount coupons, promotional
            pricing, shipping offers, or gift card incentives.

          <p>
            While we strive for complete accuracy, inadvertent pricing errors
            may occur. If a product or service is listed at an incorrect price,
            we reserve the right to cancel the order and notify you of the
            error. If the correct price is higher than what was displayed, you
            may choose to proceed with the updated amount or cancel your order
            without penalty.
